# BankingFrontEnd

The goal of this project was to create a front-end using Angular for an imaginary banking institution named "Human Bank". The application was constructed using Angular, Angular Material, and Bootstrap 5. The back-end for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Chavez102/BankingSystem_BackEnd).
